Dependency relation
1. current token is the governor (i.e head) of the realtion. i.e. amod, nsubj, dep
2. current token is the dependent of the relation. i.e. nsubj, dobj, dep


Features:
- Position
- POS
- Dependency relation
- In potential aspect list (can get from previous work, or collect by frequency)
- Sentiment Core
- Negation word area (3 or 4 words, n degres in dependency tree)



Evaluation:
Approach 1:
ATEPC -> ATE + APC

ATEPC   ->  ATE
B_pos, B_neu, B_neg  ->  B 
I  ->  I
O  ->  O

ATEPC   -> APC
For each: aspecterm in data
	y 		= [y_1, y_2, y_3] like [B_pos, I, I] --> positive
	y_pred 	= [y_pred_1, ...] like [O, B_pos, I] --> negative

Approach 2: evaluate ATEPC following [B_pos, B_neu, B_neg, I, O] --> F1 score, Precision, Recall


Work of today:
- convert to form of seemeval 2014 (ATE task)
- run evaluation by seemeval tool
- Evaluation Approach 1:
	- Convert ATEPC --> ATE
	- Convert ATEPC --> APC
- Evaluation Approach 2:
    - Get results
